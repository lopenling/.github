## :question: What Is It?

Lopenling is an end-to-end translation ecosystem. Lopenling gets its name from the translation department of Samye, the iconic monastery in Lhasa from the 8th century. Lopenling is built for the community focused on the translation of Tibetan texts, by that same community.

## :house: Ownership

There is no formal organization behind Lopenling; it is an entirely community-led project. 

## :smiley: Consensus Model

Decisions in terms of new features and other important decisions materially affecting Lopenling's usefulness are made collectively by the community through simple majority voting. 

## :page_with_curl: License

MIT license provides almost unrestricted freedom to use, modify, and distribute the code. Ensures the project remains open source but also allows for commercial use.
